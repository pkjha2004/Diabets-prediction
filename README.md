****Diabetes Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning***
-----------------------------------------------------


Welcome to our diabetes prediction project! In this repository, we explore the application of supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset based on various health-related features. Let's delve into the specific classifiers we employed and how they contributed to our predictive modeling efforts:

1. KNeighborsClassifier
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a versatile and intuitive classifier that relies on the similarity of feature vectors to make predictions. We utilized the KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn to implement KNN for diabetes prediction. Through proper visualization techniques such as scatter plots and decision boundaries, we gained insights into how the algorithm makes predictions based on the nearest neighbors' class labels. Check out the KNeighborsClassifier notebook for a detailed walkthrough of our implementation and visualization strategies.

2. DecisionTreeClassifier
Decision trees offer a transparent and interpretable approach to classification tasks, making them invaluable for understanding feature importance and decision-making processes. We harnessed the power of decision trees using the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn to predict diabetes onset. By visualizing the constructed decision tree, we gained valuable insights into the hierarchical structure of decision-making and feature importance. Explore the DecisionTreeClassifier notebook to see how we utilized decision trees for diabetes prediction and visualized the resulting tree structure.

3. MLPClassifier (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
Neural networks, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), have shown remarkable performance in various machine learning tasks, including medical diagnosis. We employed the MLPClassifier from scikit-learn to build a neural network model for diabetes prediction. Using visualization techniques such as learning curves and confusion matrices, we evaluated the MLP's performance and gained insights into its training dynamics and predictive capabilities. Dive into the MLPClassifier notebook to explore our neural network implementation and visualization strategies in detail.
